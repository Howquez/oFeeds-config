Beyond Twitter or LinkedIn-style feeds, the app could be adapted to study various social media formats or, more broadly, other digital platforms. We have developed preliminary versions of news and shopping feeds using the DICE appâ€™s framework, demonstrating its flexibility and customizability.

You can download the corresponding `*.otreezip` files below. The [Deployment](deployment.qmd#sec-deploy) chapter provides guidance for hosting these apps either locally or on your own server.

We hope to feature more DICE extensions developed by the research community in the future.
