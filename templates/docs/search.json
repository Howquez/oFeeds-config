    "text": "1.1 Overview\nThe DICE app was designed to fit into a consumer researcher’s typical workflow where participants are recruited (e.g., via Prolific) before they are exposed to stimuli and survey items (e.g., in Qualtrics). The key procedural difference in using the DICE app (compared to software such as Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Powerpoint) is that the stimuli are not configured graphically but tabularly: the DICE app requires researchers to configure a csv file that provides information on each post, such as the actual content, engagement metrics, and the corresponding username. The app then loops through that file (while filtering for conditions) to display each row as a separate post embedded in an interactive feed. The advantage of this procedural difference is that while it requires the same amount of information as the graphical configuration, it is less time consuming and less error prone because the software handles the graphical representation consistently. In addition, the tabular configuration is more accessible as researchers are trained to work with csv, as opposed to Photoshop files.\nHere, we provide a configuration csv file that serves as a template for researchers who configure their first set of stimuli. In Table 1.1, we display and describe an exemplary row of this template containing social media posts on the Yosemite National Park in California. The first column in Table 1.1 describes a configuration column’s scope, that is, whether it defines how, when and to whom a post is displayed (design), contains a post’s actual content or engagement metrics such as the number of likes the post has received (post), or whether it describes a post’s author (user). The second column lists all of the input csv file’s required configuration columns.1 We then describe the configuration columns’ data types, provide examplary values, and describe them in more detail.\nTable 1.1: Description of Input csv File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope\nColumn\nType\nExample\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndesign\ncondition\ntext\nA\nUnique identifier for the condition (e.g., group A or B).

    "section": "1.2 Design Columns",
    "text": "1.2 Design Columns\nBefore Video 1.1 describes the columns in more detail, we focus on the design columns and describe how researchers can configure them to implement their experimental designs.\n\n1.2.1 Conditions\nResearchers can leverage the condition configuration column to set up between-subjects designs by assigning the respective rows with N different values (e.g., “treatment 1”, “treatment 2”, …, “treatment N”). The DICE app will then count the number on unique values and create N different treatment groups. When launching a study, participants will then be assigned to these groups randomly and uniformly such that the group sizes do not differ in expectation. In case study 2, we show how we leveraged this variable to create two conditions that contain two different sets of nineteen organic posts but share the same sponsored post. As each row can only be assigned to one condition, this required us to enter the sponsored post twice within the configuration file: both versions contained the same post and user configurations and only differed with respect to their condition. Similarly, if researchers want to display the same set of organic posts in N conditions, then they have to enter N copies of that set of posts and adjust the condition column accordingly.\n\n\n1.2.2 Sequences\nAnother important configuration column is sequence. It defines the order in which posts are displayed and gives researchers control over the order in which posts are displayed. Explicit sequences can be useful to study ordering and ranking of social media posts. Researchers can, for instance, use the user interactions measured in a previous study to rank the by engagement to approximate a platform’s recommender systems. Importantly, this column is special as the DICE app replaces missing values with random numbers for each participant individually. This is a feature we leveraged in both of our case studies: in Case Study 2, we only defined the sequence of the sponsored post such that it was always displayed in fifth position. The sequence configuration column was not assigned to any of the organic posts. Hence, each participant experienced a different sequence of organic posts. In Case Study 1, we left that sequence column empty for every post to randomize the order of both sponsored and organic posts. This resulted in a diverse set of sequences that we exploited to study primacy effects in ad recall.\n\n\n1.2.3 Threads\nFinally, the commented_post configuration column is interesting for researches who want to investigate discussions as it changes the social media feed’s appearance slightly. If one post is assigned to a 1 in this column, this post will serve as a “parent post” whereas all other posts will be displayed a comments of that parent post.",

    "section": "1.3 Image Requirements",
    "text": "1.3 Image Requirements\nThe DICE app does not host images directly. Instead, you must provide direct links (raw URLs) to your images hosted elsewhere. These URLs should point directly to the image file itself, not to a webpage containing the image.\nWhat is a Raw Image URL? A raw image URL points directly to the image file and typically ends with a file extension like .jpg, .png, .gif, or preferably .webp. These URLs provide direct access to the image file without any surrounding webpage elements. For instance, a raw GitHub image URL might look like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/main/images/example.jpg, while an Imgur URL might be https://i.imgur.com/abcd123.png, and a Giphy URL could be https://media.giphy.com/media/abc123/giphy.gif.\n\n1.3.1 Hosting Your Own Images\nSeveral platforms can host your images for use with DICE. GitHub offers a straightforward approach: upload images to a public repository and use the raw URL that starts with raw.githubusercontent.com. Imgur provides another popular option as an image hosting service that readily provides direct image links. Cloud storage services like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage can also work well, though you’ll need to ensure public access is enabled.\n\n\n1.3.2 Getting Raw Image URLs\nThe process of obtaining a raw URL varies by platform. On GitHub, navigate to your uploaded image and click the “Raw” button - the resulting URL in your browser will start with raw.githubusercontent.com. When using services like Imgur, you can usually right-click on the uploaded image and select “Copy image address” or a similar option. The key is ensuring your URL ends with an image extension (.jpg, .png, etc.).\n\n\n1.3.3 Verifying Your URLs\nYou can easily test whether your image URL is correct by pasting it directly into a browser’s address bar. If the browser shows only the image itself, without any surrounding webpage elements, the URL is suitable for use with DICE. This simple verification step can save time troubleshooting later.",

Web-optimized formats like .webp often provide the best balance of quality and performance. There are many online converters and even python modules available.2\nIt’s crucial to understand that directly linking to images from social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) may lead to problems: if a user updates their profile picture or deletes a post, the image URL will break and your study’s stimuli will be incomplete. Instead, download any images you want to use from social media and host them on a platform you control, such as GitHub. This ensures your stimuli remain stable throughout your study’s duration.\nRemember to maintain a backup of all images and verify that your image URLs remain publicly accessible throughout your research period. This approach provides the most reliable way to ensure your study’s integrity over time.\nYou will likely create your own images. To include them in your feed, you need to host them somewhere publicly. We usually use Github for these purposes. We learnt that it makes a lot of sense to compress the images you are using such that your stimuli are less affected by slow internet connections on your participants’ side. In addition, it helps to use an image format that is optimized for web usage. We made good experiences with the .webp format.",

Each slot can be used by one participant. If there is attrition—that is, if a participant enters the study but leaves before finishing it—their slot in the database will be consumed and cannot be reused by other participants. Hence, you should account for expected attrition when specifying the number of study slots.\nFor example, if you expect a 20% dropout rate and want 100 completed responses, you should allocate approximately 125 slots.\nImportant considerations: - Once all slots are filled, no new participants can join the study - We enforce a maximum of 400 slots per study to maintain performance - If you need larger sample sizes, please contact us to discuss options - Alternatively, consider deploying a Digital In-Context Experiment yourself\n\n\n2.2.3 Automatic Participant ID Parameter Handling\nThe participant ID parameter is automatically configured based on your selected recruitment platform:\n\nProlific → Uses PROLIFIC_PID parameter\nConnect → Uses participant_label parameter\nLab Study → Uses participant_code parameter\n\nYou don’t need to manually configure these—they’re set automatically when you select your study type. When integrating with survey platforms like Qualtrics, create an Embedded Data field that matches your platform’s parameter name (e.g., PROLIFIC_PID, participant_label, or participant_code).",

    "text": "2.3 Stimulus Design\n\n2.3.1 Social Media Platform\n\n\n2.3.2 URL\nIn this section, you will provide the csv file you created to configure your stimuli as described in Chapter 1. The DICE app “ingests” these configurations if you provide raw URL to the file. This requires you to upload the csv file in a publicly available storage (we recommend GitHub as it is free and easy-to-use).\nThe DICE app needs access to your CSV file through what’s called a “raw” URL. A raw URL points directly to the file’s content, allowing DICE to read your configuration. Think of it as a direct link to the raw data, rather than a webpage showing the file.\n\n2.3.2.1 What is a Raw URL?\nWhen you share files through platforms like GitHub, the standard URL typically leads to a webpage that displays your file. However, DICE needs a special type of URL - a raw URL - that leads directly to the file’s content. A raw URL usually follows this pattern:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/main/filename.csv\nThe key difference is that a raw URL starts with raw. in the domain name. This tells the server to send the pure file content rather than a webpage displaying the file.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Getting a Raw URL\nIf you’re using GitHub, you can find the raw URL by navigating to your file and clicking the “Raw” button. The URL in your browser will then show the correct format that DICE needs. If you prefer using Google Drive, you can share your CSV file and get a direct link. First, share the file by setting it to “Anyone with the link can view.” Then, instead of using the standard sharing link, modify it by replacing “file/d/” with “uc?export=download&id=” and removing everything after the file ID. Your Google Drive URL should look like this:\nhttps://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Using Your Raw URL\nOnce you have the raw URL, simply paste it into DICE where requested. The app will automatically fetch your configuration file and use it to set up your study.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 CSV Delimiter\nYour CSV file uses a special character to separate different pieces of data (like columns). While commas are the most common delimiter, some files use other characters. DICE can auto-detect the correct delimiter, but you can also manually select the character that matches your CSV file format—for example, if your data is separated by semicolons, choose “Semicolon” from the dropdown menu.\n\n\n2.3.4 Search Term\nEnter the term you want participants to see in the search bar of your simulated social media interface. Using a hashtag or a username creates a more authentic social media experience, as it mimics how users typically search for content on platforms like Twitter. This search term will appear pre-filled in the interface’s search bar when participants start the study. For example, you might use #myHashtag, @username, or a specific topic like climatechange.\n\n\n2.3.5 Validating Your CSV File (Recommended)\nBefore creating your session, you can test your CSV file to ensure it’s properly formatted and accessible. Click the “Test CSV” button to:\n\nVerify that the CSV URL is accessible and working\nAuto-detect the correct delimiter if needed\nCheck that all required columns are present\nIdentify any potential issues with your data\n\nThis validation step helps catch configuration errors early and makes troubleshooting easier if anything goes wrong.",

Different recruitment platforms provide completion codes in different ways:\n\nProlific: Generates a unique completion code that participants must submit at the end of the study to confirm completion and receive payment\nConnect (Cloud Research): May use completion codes or require a redirect back to their platform with specific parameters\nLab Studies: You typically manage completion verification directly (e.g., via course credit systems or manual verification)\n\nBest Practice for Data Integrity: The most secure approaches to handle completion codes are: 1. Code-based: Provide participants with a unique completion code at the end of your survey that they submit back to the recruitment platform 2. Redirect-based: Have your survey redirect participants back to the recruitment platform with a completion confirmation, which automatically verifies their participation\nThis ensures that participants who complete your DICE study and survey can properly confirm their participation without relying on self-reporting. Check your recruitment platform’s documentation for their specific completion code requirements and implementation methods.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Dwell Time Tracking\nThe dwell time tracking threshold determines when DICE considers a social media post as “viewed” by the participant. This setting is expressed as a percentage of the post’s visibility in the participant’s browser window:\n\nA threshold of 75% (default) means a post must be 75% visible to be considered “in view”\nLower values (closer to 1%) will count posts as viewed even when barely visible\nHigher values (closer to 100%) only count posts that are almost fully visible\n\nChoose your threshold based on how strictly you want to measure post exposure. For most studies, the default value of 75% provides a good balance between capturing meaningful exposure while allowing for natural scrolling behavior.",

    "text": "2.6 Create Session\nAfter clicking “Create Session,” you’ll see a confirmation screen that contains all essential information for running your study and collecting data.\n\n2.6.1 Saving Your Session Information\nThe success screen displays your unique session code (such as h4qfjieu) and a corresponding session URL. These identifiers are crucial as they provide the only way to monitor your study’s progress and download your data later. Make sure to save both the code and URL in a secure location for future reference.\n\n\n2.6.2 Prolific Integration\nThis section is relevant only if you’re using Prolific for participant recruitment.\nThe success screen provides a specially formatted URL that includes Prolific’s parameter structure. It looks similar to this:\nhttps://ibt-hsg.herokuapp.com/join/pifararu/?participant_label={{%PROLIFIC_PID%}}&prolific_study_id={{%STUDY_ID%}}&prolific_session_id={{%SESSION_ID%}}\nSteps to integrate with Prolific:\n\nCopy the entire URL from the success screen\nPaste it (as is) into your Prolific study details\nIn Qualtrics, create an Embedded Data field named PROLIFIC_PID to capture the Prolific participant ID\n\nThe URL contains three important placeholders: - {%PROLIFIC_PID%} captures each participant’s unique identifier - {%STUDY_ID%} tracks your specific study - {%SESSION_ID%} records individual participant sessions\nYou’ll also find a field to enter your Prolific completion code. This code needs to be entered and submitted to allow participants to confirm their participation after completing your study. The system automatically handles the completion code distribution to eligible participants, ensuring proper compensation through Prolific’s system.\n\n\n2.6.3 Connect (Cloud Research) Integration\nThis section is relevant only if you’re using Connect (Cloud Research) for participant recruitment.\nAfter creating your session, you’ll see information about how to set up your study in Connect:\n\nCopy the session URL from the DICE success screen\nIn Connect, set the “Collecting Connect IDs” field to use participant_label as the parameter name\nThis ensures Connect will append ?participant_label=XXX when redirecting participants to your study\nIn Qualtrics, create an Embedded Data field named participant_label to capture the Connect participant ID\n\nThis integration allows you to automatically track which Connect participants completed your study and link their DICE responses with their survey data.\n\n\n2.6.4 Lab Study Integration (Single-Use Links)\nThis section is relevant only if you’re running a lab study with single-use participant links.\nWhen you select “Lab Study (Single-Use Links)” as your study type, DICE generates unique participant links for each participant slot:\n\nAfter creating your session, navigate to the Session Details (accessible via the admin interface using your session code)\nYou’ll find a list of single-use participant links, each containing a unique participant_code\nDistribute these links to your participants individually (via email, on printed cards, etc.)\nEach link can only be used once, ensuring each participant receives a unique identifier\nIn Qualtrics or your survey platform, create an Embedded Data field named participant_code to capture this identifier\nThis allows you to match DICE data with survey responses for each participant\n\nThis approach is ideal for in-person lab studies where you have direct control over participant recruitment and link distribution.",

    "text": "3.1 Raw Data\nWe created the shiny-app to pre-process the raw data (which is tabular but also contains columns with JSON formatted data to describe the participant\\(\\times\\)post-level observations).\nThe shiny-app requires you to upload your raw DICE data and transforms its wide to a long format. It then provides a download-button. Below, we briefly describe the raw data before we turn our attention to the output of the shiny-app, that is, the processed data. In both sections, we use the data collected in Case Study 1 and anonymize the Prolific IDs (called participant labels).\nWhile creating an experimental session, the DICE web app returns session code such as r5fbdbr1, for instance. It will also create a url containing that session code (e.g., https://ibt-hsg.herokuapp.com/SessionStartLinks/r5fbdbr1) directing you to you oTree interface, where you can monitor the session or download the data. After clicking on the Data tab, you can download the raw data by clicking on the Plain button in the bottom right of her screen. This will generate a csv file called all_apps_wide_YYYY-MM-DD.csv.\nThis data follows oTree’s conventions as displayed in Table 3.1.1\nTable 3.1: Excerpt of Raw Data Analyzed in Case Study

    "text": "4.1 Case Study 1: Feed Composition and Context Effects\nTwo case studies illustrate the application of DICE. These studies are designed to replicate and expand classic context effects within a more ecologically valid social media feed environment using DICE. The focus of the case studies is to illustrate the usage and resulting data streams of DICE rather than advancing theory. This section aims to achieve two objectives. First, the studies demonstrate the ability to manipulate entire feed compositions and sequences, rather than just individual social media posts. Second, they demonstrate how post-level dwell time measurements can be used to approximate attention, complementing insights gained from traditional self-report measures. Substantively, Case Study 1 examines how content surrounding a sponsored post affects brand perceptions, while Case Study 2 explores how the specific position of a post within a feed influences attention and brand recall.\nCase Study 1 demonstrates DICE’s capability to study context effects with high experimental control and study realism. This study illustrates how researchers can systematically manipulate the broader context (i.e., the composition of the feed) in which users encounter a specific post (in this case, a sponsored post from a brand). Substantively, Case Study 1 examines the issue of brand safety in social media advertising. Brand safety refers to the idea that advertising should not appear in contexts that could harm a brand’s reputation (Fournier and Srinivasan 2023). This concern is particularly relevant for social media advertising, where platforms use automated systems to place ads in dynamic, user-generated content environments. These systems often lack the nuanced understanding needed to identify potentially problematic contexts that could harm a brand. While industry reports suggest that up to 75% of brands have experienced such unsafe brand exposures (Ahmad et al. 2024; GumGum Inc. 2017), examining these effects in the field risks apparent brand damage.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Experimental Design\nTo test how brand (un)safe contexts affect brand perceptions, we created two social media feeds that were identical in structure but varied in their content surrounding a sponsored post (see Figure 4.11 for exemplary screenshots of the brand (un)safe feeds). The sponsored post in both conditions was an ad by the airline KLM promoting flights to Brazil.\nIn the brand-safe condition, the sponsored post was surrounded by actual organic posts covering Brazil scraped from the web. In the brand-unsafe condition, however, the sponsored post was surrounded by another set of scraped organic posts about the severe flooding that occurred during the time of the study. Such a situation is precisely the type of contextual mismatch that automated systems can create and managers fear due to the adverse consequences for brands (Ahmad et al. 2024; GumGum Inc. 2017). In both conditions, the sponsored post was always fixed in the fifth position, whereas the order of the organic posts varied randomly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Exemplary DICE Feeds from Case Study 1\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Procedure\nWe recruited 982 US-American participants on Prolific (\\(M_{age} = 39\\) years; 56% female) to participate in the study. Participants browsed the simulated feed on their own devices (75% desktop, 21% mobile, and 4% tablet). After scrolling through the feed, participants were redirected to a Qualtrics survey in which they first provided demographic information as a filler task. Next, participants reported their brand attitude toward KLM using three seven-point scales (1 = “Negative/Unfavorable/Dislike” and 7 = “Positive/Favorable/Like”; \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.96). Finally, we assessed participants’ awareness of the Brazil flooding. For this and all studies, all stimuli, materials, data, and analysis code are available on the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://osf.io/2xs5c/?view_only=4bf95d2a2c8449218b5fa7cd288f626a.\n\n\n4.1.3 Stimuli\nBuilding on the CSV file structure introduced in Case Study 1, we created a file containing two distinct sets of content: nineteen organic posts for each experimental condition, plus one sponsored post that needed to appear in both feeds. To ensure the sponsored post would appear in both conditions while maintaining DICE’s CSV structure, we entered the sponsored post twice in the file - once for each condition. This resulted in a file with forty rows total: nineteen organic posts for each condition plus the sponsored post appearing twice. Each post’s content was specified in columns such as &lt;text&gt; and &lt;username&gt;. We used the &lt;condition&gt; parameter to distinguish between our brand-safebrand-unsafe feeds, assigning each row (i.e., each post) to its respective condition. Similar to Case Study 1, we left the &lt;sequence&gt; column empty for organic posts to enable randomization, with one key exception: the KLM sponsored post was assigned a fixed &lt;sequence&gt; value of “5” to ensure consistent positioning across conditions. We marked this post as sponsored using the &lt;sponsored&gt; parameter and included a KLM landing page URL in the &lt;target&gt; column for participants who clicked on the ad. The resulting CSV file was uploaded to an online repository to generate a URL for the DICE app.\nTable 4.1 shows an excerpt of the exact CSV files we used to create the stimuli for this study.

A key advantage of DICE over observational and platform studies is its ability to implement true random assignment, allowing us to isolate the effect of context while canceling out other factors that might influence brand perception. To validate DICE’s randomization functionality, we examined the balance between treatment groups: as illustrated in Table 4.2, the two treatment groups do not exhibit differences in observables. Following Kerwin, Rostom, and Sterck (2024), we also found support for balanced conditions in an omnibus test of joint orthogonality with randomization inference (\\(p=\\) 0.39).\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Covariate Balance Across Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariate\nSafe\nUnsafe\nDifference\np-value\n\n\n\n\nMean Age (Years)\n38.848\n38.522\n-0.326\n0.702\n\n\nFemale (Percent)\n58.439\n54.262\n-4.177\n0.194\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Data\nOur dataset comprises 955 participants and 15,343 observations at the participant \\(\\times\\) post level. Whereas Case Study 1 analyzed multiple sponsored posts across participants, here we focus on a single sponsored post (i.e., the KLM ad) viewed by all participants, which simplifies our analytical approach. Our final sample comprises 955 observations on the participant level, which is slightly less than the expected one observation per participant due to connectivity issues: no dwell time data were recorded for around 0.00% of the sponsored posts.\nThis simplified “short” data structure has two convenient methodological implications. First, because we analyze one observation per participant rather than nested data, we can apply simpler methods such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions in our analyses. Second, because we only focus on one sponsored post, we do not need to divide our dwell time measure by the post’s height as we did in Case Study 1. Both aspects increase the interpretability of our results.\nTable 4.3 shows an excerpt of the processed data to illustrate its nested (i.e., “long”) structure.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Processed Data Analyzed in Study 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant ID\nPosition in Feed\nLikes\nReplies\nSeconds in Viewport\nDwell Time\nBrand Attitudes\nAge\nFemale\nDesktop\nRecall\n\n\n\n\n59e833e72f63d30001c8fb86\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n1.783\n0.5782973\n4.000000\n36\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n59f226a9d6380600018b2923\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n6.393\n1.8552036\n5.333333\n60\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\n\n\n5a0ef93279f96a0001c73f25\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n3.500\n1.2527630\n4.000000\n31\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a42c80ddaea400001ac24e0\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n10.239\n2.3262040\n5.000000\n47\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a542b96e0cf3d0001260df1\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n1.111\n0.1052605\n4.000000\n38\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a5c2c2eeedc320001429df1\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n20.422\n3.0166128\n4.000000\n33\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a7618b18fe2dc0001057243\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n3.866\n1.3522204\n6.000000\n43\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a78e410ae9a0b0001a97274\n5\nTRUE\nFALSE\n5.915\n1.7774915\n6.000000\n32\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a91756d6475f900019f90f1\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n4.484\n1.5005155\n4.000000\n43\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a9fc2b66475f90001a0219a\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n3.165\n1.1521531\n1.333333\n31\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5aaf4b0ce1546900019b01de\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.301\n-1.2006450\n4.000000\n43\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Results and Discussion\nBrand attitudes toward KLM were significantly less positive in the brand-unsafe feed condition (\\(M_u = 4.310\\), \\(SD_u = 1.366\\)) compared to the brand-safe feed condition (\\(M_s = 4.821\\), \\(SD_s = 1.161\\), \\(b = -.510\\), \\(SE = .082\\), \\(t(953)  = -6.217\\), \\(p = .000\\), \\(d = .403\\)).\nTo further explore the interplay between the KLM ad’s context and brand attitudes, we examined whether the dwell time of the ad moderated the previously reported main effect of context. An OLS regression revealed a statistically significant interaction between the context’s brand safety and dwell time (\\(b = -.302\\), \\(SE = .068\\), \\(t(951) = -4.455\\), \\(p = .000\\)), indicating that the lack of attention shapes how context affects brand attitudes (see Figure 4.2). This suggests that the negative effect of an unsafe context on brand attitude only emerged when participants spent a sufficient amount of time viewing the sponsored post. In contrast, among those participants with minimal dwell time, there was little difference in brand attitudes between safe and unsafe contexts. The main effects of brand safety (\\(b = -.020\\), \\(SE = .137\\), \\(t(951) = -.143\\), \\(p = .886\\)) and dwell time (\\(b = .096\\), \\(SE = .050\\), \\(t(951) = 1.929\\), \\(p = .054\\)) were not significant. The ad’s dwell time did not vary across brand safety conditions (\\(b = -.002\\), \\(SE = .078\\), \\(t(953) = -4.662\\), \\(p = .982\\)). Finally, this moderation is robust to alternative model specifications (see Section 4.1.7) where we repeated the same analysis while controlling for the dwell time allocated to all organic posts (\\(b = -.316\\), \\(SE = .068\\), \\(t(950) = -4.662\\), \\(p = .000\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Moderation of the Effect of Context on Brand Attitudes by Dwell Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a substantive perspective, the findings provide experimental support for brand safety concerns and reveal an intuitive nuance: contextual misplacements primarily harm brand perceptions when consumers pay sufficient attention to the content. When attention is minimal (indicated by minimal dwell times), the negative impact of unsafe contexts appears to be neutralized. From a methodological perspective, this study illustrates how researchers can manipulate entire feed compositions rather than just single social media posts. It also showcases how DICE’s dwell time data can be interpreted as a proxy of attention. A lack of dwell time for a post, however, implies a lack of attention to this content.\n\n\n4.1.7 Robustness Checks\nTo test the robustness of our findings, we conducted additional analyses controlling for participants’ dwell time on organic posts that constituted our experimental manipulation. Since the brand safety manipulation involved varying the content of organic posts surrounding the sponsored ad (brand-safe vs. brand-unsafe), it was important to verify that our results were not simply driven by differential attention to these organic posts across conditions.\nModels 1 and 2 in Table Table 4.4 feature the main findings reported in the manuscript. Model 3 adds the dwell time on all organic posts as a covariate, while Model 4 replaces the dwell time on the sponsored post with the dwell time on the organic posts. Both models demonstrate that our key findings (i.e., the main effects as well as the interaction between brand safety and dwell time) were robust. The interaction effect (Brand-Unsafe × Dwell Time KLM) remained significant, indicating that the moderating role of attention on context effects persists even after accounting for engagement with the manipulated organic content. Model 4 additionally shows that dwell time on organic posts also moderates the brand safety effect.\n\n\n\nTable 4.4: Estimates of Brand Attitude as a Function of Brand Safety and Dwell Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel 1\n\n\nModel 2\n\n\nModel 3\n\n\nModel 4\n\n\n\nb\nSE\n1\np\nb\nSE\n1\np\nb\nSE\n1\np\nb\nSE\n1\np\n\n\n\n\nBrand-Unsafe\n-0.510\n0.082\n&lt;0.001\n-0.020\n0.137\n0.886\n-0.006\n0.137\n0.962\n0.834\n0.556\n0.134\n\n\nDwell Time (KLM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.096\n0.050\n0.054\n0.057\n0.052\n0.275\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDwell Time (Organic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.175\n0.064\n0.007\n0.214\n0.083\n0.010\n\n\n    Brand-Unsafe × Dwell Time (KLM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.302\n0.068\n&lt;0.001\n-0.316\n0.068\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Brand-Unsafe × Dwell Time (Organic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.284\n0.116\n0.014\n\n\nConstant\n4.821\n0.058\n&lt;0.001\n4.664\n0.099\n&lt;0.001\n3.901\n0.297\n&lt;0.001\n3.810\n0.395\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nR²\n0.039\n\n\n\n\n0.062\n\n\n\n\n0.070\n\n\n\n\n0.046\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nSE = Standard Error",

    "section": "4.2 Case Study 2: Position Effects and Competing Attention Between Brands",
    "text": "4.2 Case Study 2: Position Effects and Competing Attention Between Brands\nRather than focusing on a single post, Case Study 2 examines how multiple brands compete for user attention within the same feed—a common scenario in social media advertising where multiple advertisers target the same user and try to “cut through the clutter” of both organic content and competing ads (Ordenes et al. 2019). Case Study 2 also illustrates how to approximate attention patterns across an entire feed containing multiple sponsored posts from different advertisers in the same product category. By studying how users engage with multiple sponsored posts in a single feed, we can better understand the dynamics of attention allocation in social media environments where brands compete for attention simultaneously, building on related memory and context effects studied in traditional advertising environments (Pieters, Warlop, and Wedel 2002). Specifically, we examine how the position of sponsored posts affects brand recall when multiple brands are presented within the same feed, and how the dwell times captured through DICE help explain these effects.\n\n4.2.1 Experimental Design\nTo investigate the relationship between ad placement and recall, we simulated social media feeds containing both organic and sponsored posts. Whereas the set of organic and sponsored posts was the same for all participants, the sequence in which the participants were exposed to these posts was unique for every participant as we randomized the sequence between subjects.\nTo investigate the relationship between ad placement and brand recall, we simulated a social media feed containing both organic and sponsored posts. Whereas the set of organic and sponsored posts was the same for all participants, we randomized the sequence in which participants were exposed to these posts between subjects.\nThe feed featured thirty-five organic posts and five consumer electronics ads (sponsored posts; see Figure 4.32 for example feeds). We selected multiple ads from established consumer electronics brands (i.e., Apple, Bose, Nintendo, Samsung, Whoop).3 The sponsored posts were actual ads retrieved from Facebook’s Ad Library, a publicly accessible database that archives advertisements run by advertisers across Meta’s platforms. The selected sponsored posts shared similar basic characteristics, including the presence of a product image, brand logo, and brief text as part of the advertisement. The organic content featured a collection of memes taken from the platform 9gag, a popular internet meme collection with over sixteen million followers on X. We intentionally chose memes as organic content to offer a conservative test of how branded content “competes” for attention on social media, particularly among younger users (Malodia et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Exemplary DICE Feeds from Case Study 2\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Procedure\nWe recruited 300 younger American participants from Prolific (\\(M_{age}\\)=29.42 years; 53% female). Participants browsed the simulated feed on their own devices (72% desktop, 25% mobile, and 3% tablet). After scrolling through the feed, we redirected participants to a Qualtrics survey in which participants first provided demographic information as a filler task. Next, we measured whether participants recalled seeing the ads by the five brands in the feed. Specifically, we measured both free and cued recall. To measure cued recall, we showed participants a list of twenty brands from different categories and asked them to indicate whether they recalled seeing them (Campbell and Keller 2003; Simonov, Valletti, and Veiga 2025), including a no-recall option. The results for both recall measures were highly consistent; we report the cued recall results in the manuscript for parsimony (the results for unaided recall are reported in Section 4.2.7.1).\n\n\n4.2.3 Stimuli\nWe next illustrate how we configured the feed to match our experimental design. Specifically, we created a CSV file that contains forty rows where each row represents one unique post. To guarantee that the order in which the posts were displayed was randomized between participants, we left the &lt;sequence&gt; column empty. Whenever the DICE app encounters missing values in that column, it assigns random numbers to that cell. Hence, leaving some, or in our case, all cells of this column empty, leads to random numbers and thus, random sequences in which the posts are displayed. Next, we specified the Boolean &lt;sponsored&gt; column and assigned a 0 to all thirty-five organic posts and a 1 to the five sponsored posts. For these sponsored posts, we also specified a &lt;target&gt; which is the URL of landing page participants are directed to if they click on the corresponding sponsored post. As a final step, we uploaded the CSV file to an online repository to create a URL that can be passed to DICE’s web app.\nTable 4.1 shows an excerpt of the exact CSV files we used to create the stimuli for this study.

In our analyses, we only focus on sponsored posts which is why our final sample comprises 1,283 observations on the participant \\(\\times\\) sponsored post level. This is less than the expected five observations per participant due to two reasons. First, due to connectivity issues: no dwell time data were recorded for around 3.67% of individual–sponsored post pairs. Second, we excluded the first and last two posts of each feed (i.e., \\(300 \\times 4\\) observations) from our analysis, as meaningful dwell times couldn’t be determined for these. This is because participants were familiarizing themselves with the interface at the start and deciding whether to proceed to the next stage of the study at the end of the feeds.\n\n\n4.2.4.2 Variables\nPosition in feed (subsequently referred to only as “position”) is our main independent variable. Because we randomized the order in which the content appeared (i.e., position acts as a within-subject factor) and because we excluded observations positioned at the beginning and the end of the feed, we observe a sample mean of 20.58 as well as a minimum and maximum of 3 and 38, respectively. As, we randomly manipulated the position in which each post was displayed exogenously between subjects, each sequence in which participants browsed through ads was unique.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Distribution of Sponsored Post Impressions by Position in Feed and Brand across All Participants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.4, each line represents the number of times a sponsored post for a specific brand appeared at each position across all participants. As the placements were fully randomized, we observed some random variability that naturally fluctuates around the expected value of 7.5 impressions per position (as indicated by dashed lines).4 Taken together, this suggests that randomization within the DICE app was effective.\nWe measured dwell times as the number of seconds at least 50 percent of a post’s pixels were visible on screen. We log-transformed the raw dwell times to reduce skewness. Unlike Case Study 2, where we focused on a single post (i.e., the KLM ad), the focal posts of interest (i.e., ads) in this Case Study vary in their post height. Thus, and as described in the “Behavioral Data” section of the DICE App Implementation, we normalized our dwell time measure by dividing it by post height to control for differently sized posts (i.e., the height in pixels of the corresponding sponsored post on a participant’s screen).\nWe also tracked actual reactions to the content such as likes and replies to individual posts. In the full sample featuring both organic and sponsored posts, we observed 144 (30) participants who liked (replied to) any post in the feed. These numbers are obviously lower for sponsored posts (ads shown in the feed) with 32 (4) participants liked (replied to) at least one sponsored post or ad. Given the low incident rate, we did not analyze these likes and comments any further.\nTable 4.6 shows an excerpt of the processed data to illustrate its nested (i.e., “long”) structure.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.6: Processed Data Analyzed in Study 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant ID\nPost ID\nSponsored Post\nBrand\nPosition in Feed\nLikes\nReplies\nSeconds in Viewport\nlog(Seconds in Viewport)\nPost Height\nDwell Time\nAge\nFemale\nDesktop\nRecall Apple\nRecall Bose\nRecall Nintendo\nRecall Samsung\nRecall Whoop\n\n\n\n\n66ee9436fdc916ec83068569\n14\nFALSE\nNA\n35\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.083\n-2.4889147\n383\n-0.0064985\n33\nTRUE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66ee9436fdc916ec83068569\n13\nFALSE\nNA\n36\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.117\n-2.1455813\n420\n-0.0051085\n33\nTRUE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66ee9436fdc916ec83068569\n18\nFALSE\nNA\n37\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.150\n-1.8971200\n416\n-0.0045604\n33\nTRUE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66ee9436fdc916ec83068569\n30\nFALSE\nNA\n38\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.167\n-1.7897615\n402\n-0.0044521\n33\nTRUE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66ee9436fdc916ec83068569\n19\nFALSE\nNA\n39\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.234\n-1.4524342\n388\n-0.0037434\n33\nTRUE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66ee9436fdc916ec83068569\n34\nFALSE\nNA\n40\nFALSE\nFALSE\n2.705\n0.9951019\n385\n0.0025847\n33\nTRUE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66f043f0c38f7c2ec60770e4\n3\nFALSE\nNA\n1\nFALSE\nFALSE\n4.614\n1.5290952\n622\n0.0024584\n30\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66f043f0c38f7c2ec60770e4\n24\nFALSE\nNA\n2\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.376\n-0.9781661\n507\n-0.0019293\n30\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66f043f0c38f7c2ec60770e4\n4\nFALSE\nNA\n3\nFALSE\nFALSE\n1.042\n0.0411419\n512\n0.0000804\n30\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66f043f0c38f7c2ec60770e4\n36\nTRUE\nApple\n4\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.180\n-1.7147984\n622\n-0.0027569\n30\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n66f043f0c38f7c2ec60770e4\n37\nTRUE\nWhoop\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.382\n-0.9623347\n646\n-0.0014897\n30\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Empirical Model\nTo estimate the impact of ad positioning on brand recall in social media feeds, we employed a mixed-effects logistic regression model with brand fixed effects to account for the binary nature of recall outcome (recalled vs. not recalled) while considering the hierarchical structure of our data: multiple observations nested within participants and ads. We assume a binomial distribution as each observation represents a single trial with two possible outcomes (recalled vs. not recalled), where \\(p_{ij}\\) represents the probability of participant \\(i\\) recalling brand \\(j\\):\n\\[\n\\text{recall}_{ij} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(1, p_{ij})\n\\]\nWe estimated the effect of ad positioning on recall and captured between-participant heterogeneity through random intercepts while controlling for brand fixed effects:\n\\[\n\\text{logit}(p_{ij}) = a + a_i + \\mathbf{x}_{ij} \\mathbf{b} + \\sum_{j=1}^{J-1} \\gamma_j \\text{Brand}_j\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is the global intercept, \\(a_i\\) is the participant-specific random intercept, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{ij}\\) is a vector of continuous predictors (e.g., position and dwell time) with corresponding coefficient vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and \\(\\gamma_j\\) represents the fixed effects for each brand \\(j\\) (with Apple serving as the reference category). The random participant effects \\(a_i\\) follows from our experimental design, given that the random assignment of ad positions ensures zero correlation between participant characteristics and the explanatory variables. Brand effects are treated as fixed parameters rather than random effects, allowing for potential correlation between brand characteristics and positioning.\nThe random participant effects \\(a_i\\) follows from our experimental design, given that the random assignment of ad positions ensures zero correlation between participant characteristics and the explanatory variables. Brand effects are treated as fixed parameters rather than random effects, allowing for potential correlation between brand characteristics and core explanatory variables such as dwell time.\nFinally, for better comparability between models, we z-standardized all explanatory variables. The regression coefficients effects on the dependent variable are therefore quantified in standard deviations. This allowed us to compare the relative effect sizes between regression models. Because of the logit link, the odds ratio is \\(100 \\times (e^{\\beta} - 1)\\), which gives the percentage change in the odds of recall.\n\n\n4.2.6 Results and Discussion\nThe effect of position on recall was significant and negative (\\(\\beta_1\\) = -.207, SE = .070, z = -2.955, p = .003; see Model 1 in Table 4.7), suggesting a primacy effect such that the further up (down) an ad is displayed in a feed, the more (less) participants recall seeing the ad. We also examined potential non-linear effects of position (i.e., to assess whether especially the beginning and end of a feed promote ad recall) by adding a quadratic term, but found no statistically significant effect. These results are robust to alternative model specifications, using uncued recall (instead of cued recall) as our dependent variable (see Section 4.2.7.1).\nAs shown in Model 2 in Table 4.7, the post-level dwell time of a user significantly predicts ad recall (\\(\\beta_3\\) = .714, SE = .091, z = 7.832, p = .000). More importantly, we also found that the dwell time allocated to an ad was a stronger predictor of recall than the position of the ad in the feed. Specifically, Model 3, including both position and dwell time, shows that the effect of position becomes non-significant (\\(\\beta_1\\) = -.104, SE = .072, z = -1.434, p = .152), while the dwell time coefficient remains unchanged and significant (\\(\\beta_3\\) = .694, SE = .092, z = 7.550, p = .000). The minimal change in the Akaike information criterion when adding the position coefficients between Model 2 and Model 3 suggests that including ad position does not improve the model’s fit to the data. A subsequent 1-1-1 hierarchical mediation analysis (Zhang, Zyphur, and Preacher 2008) indeed supports that post-level dwell time significantly mediates the relationship between ad position and recall (\\(a \\times b = -.019\\), 95% CI = [-.026, -.013], proportion mediated = .546, 95% CI = [.301, 1.555], p = .000). Section 4.2.7.2 reports additional analyses that suggest limited heterogeneity in these patterns across different sponsored posts. While brands may differ in their baseline dwell times due to potential familiarity differences, dwell time consistently predicts recall across brands.\n\n\n\nTable 4.7: Estimates of Recall as a Function of Ad Position and Dwell Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel 1\n\n\nModel 2\n\n\nModel 3\n\n\n\nbeta\n1\nSE\n1\np\nbeta\n1\nSE\n1\np\nbeta\n1\nSE\n1\np\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.821\n0.170\n&lt;0.001\n-1.118\n0.172\n&lt;0.001\n-1.082\n0.186\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPosition\n-0.207\n0.070\n0.003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.104\n0.072\n0.152\n\n\nPosition²\n0.028\n0.077\n0.719\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.029\n0.079\n0.710\n\n\nDwell Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.714\n0.091\n&lt;0.001\n0.694\n0.092\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nAIC\n1,476\n\n\n\n\n1,405\n\n\n\n\n1,407\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nOR = Odds Ratio, SE = Standard Error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a substantive perspective, the findings demonstrate how memory formation operates when brands compete for limited attention in a social media environment, consistent with prior work on attention and memory under competitive exposure (Pieters, Warlop, and Wedel 2002). From a more methodological perspective, Case Study 2 demonstrates how to combine the behavioral data (i.e., post-level dwell time as a proxy of attention) with self-reports from conventional survey measures (e.g., recall of branded content).\n\n\n4.2.7 Robustness Checks\n\n4.2.7.1 Uncued Recall\nHere, we reproduce Table 4.7 using uncued (or “free”) instead of cued recall as our dependent variable, using the same empirical strategy as before.\nTable 4.8 reproduces these findings and shows that they are robust to this alternative model specification: we still observe a primacy effect in out naïve Model 1 that vanishes as we control for dwell time in Model 3.\nThe effect of position on uncued recall was significant and negative (\\(\\beta_1\\) = -.180, SE = .075, z = -2.409, p = .016; see Model 1 in Table 4.8), suggesting a primacy effect such that the further up (down) an ad is displayed in a feed, the more (less) participants recall seeing the ad. We also examined potential non-linear effects of position (i.e., to assess whether especially the beginning and end of a feed promote uncued ad recall) by adding a quadratic term, but found no statistically significant effect.\nAs shown in Model 2 in Table 4.8, the post-level dwell time of a user significantly predicts uncued recall (\\(\\beta_3\\) = .596, SE = .090, z = 6.589, p = .000). More importantly, we also found that the dwell time allocated to an ad was a stronger predictor of uncued recall than the position of the ad in the feed. Specifically, Model 3, including both position and dwell time, shows that the effect of position becomes non-significant (\\(\\beta_1\\) = -.095, SE = .078, z = -1.221, p = .222), while the dwell time coefficient remains unchanged and significant (\\(\\beta_3\\) = .579, SE = .091, z = 6.348, p = .000). The minimal change in the Akaike information criterion when adding the position coefficients between Model 2 and Model 3 suggests that including ad position does not improve the model’s fit to the data. A subsequent 1-1-1 hierarchical mediation analysis (Zhang, Zyphur, and Preacher 2008) indeed supports that post-level dwell time significantly mediates the relationship between ad position and uncued recall (\\(a \\times b = -.014\\), 95% CI = [-.019, -.009], proportion mediated = .515, 95% CI = [.243, 1.684], p = .016).\n\n\n\nTable 4.8: Estimates of Uncued Recall as a Function of Ad Position and Dwell Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel 1\n\n\nModel 2\n\n\nModel 3\n\n\n\nbeta\n1\nSE\n1\np\nbeta\n1\nSE\n1\np\nbeta\n1\nSE\n1\np\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-1.188\n0.179\n&lt;0.001\n-1.473\n0.183\n&lt;0.001\n-1.454\n0.199\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPosition\n-0.180\n0.075\n0.016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.095\n0.078\n0.222\n\n\nPosition²\n0.033\n0.082\n0.690\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-0.013\n0.085\n0.873\n\n\nDwell Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.596\n0.090\n&lt;0.001\n0.579\n0.091\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nAIC\n1,274\n\n\n\n\n1,225\n\n\n\n\n1,227\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nOR = Odds Ratio, SE = Standard Error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.7.2 Ad Position, Dwell Time, and Recall Across Brands\nAd recall significantly varied across brands. Figure 4.5 (Panel A) visualizes the relationship between dwell time and position across the five brands in our study. We observe a consistent negative relationship between position and dwell time across all brands, with posts placed later in the feed receiving less attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Ad Position, Dwell Time, and Recall Across Brands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we also find that Apple and Nintendo generated significantly higher dwell time than all other brands (see the parallel upward shift of the regression line compared to Bose, Samsung, and Whoop). Panel B further shows how dwell time predicts recall probability consistently across all brands. The positive slope of all curves in Panel B indicates that increased dwell time enhances recall probability across all brands consistently, even for less familiar brands like Whoop. This suggests that while brands may differ in their baseline dwell time due to potential familiarity differences, we find a highly consistent empirical regularity of how dwell time ultimately predicts recall.\n\n\n\n\nAhmad, Wajeeha, Ananya Sen, Charles Eesley, and Erik Brynjolfsson. 2024. “Companies Inadvertently Fund Online Misinformation Despite Consumer Backlash.” Nature 630: 123–31. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07404-1.\n\n\nCampbell, Margaret C., and Kevin Lane Keller. 2003. “Brand Familiarity and Advertising Repetition Effects.” Journal of Consumer Research 30 (2): 292–304. https://doi.org/10.1086/376800.\n\n\nFournier, Susan, and Shuba Srinivasan. 2023. “Monitoring Marketing Sources of Brand Reputation Risk.” NIM Marketing Intelligence Review 15 (1): 46–53. https://doi.org/doi:10.2478/nimmir-2023-0007.\n\n\nGumGum Inc. 2017. “The New Brand Safety Crisis: A Fractured Environment.” GumGum. https://web.archive.org/web/20220317063148/https://insights.gumgum.com/hubfs/Brand_Safety_GumGum.pdf.\n\n\nKerwin, Jason, Nada Rostom, and Olivier Sterck. 2024. “Striking the Right Balance: Why Standard Balance Tests over-Reject the Null, and How to Fix It.” IZA Discussion Paper 17217.

    "text": "The figure shows how DICE enables the controlled manipulation of feed contexts. The identical sponsored post by KLM (highlighted) appears in the “brand-safe” feeds (left) surrounded by neutral Brazil content versus “brand-unsafe” feeds (right) where it appears alongside posts about the Brazil flooding disaster. The sponsored post always remains in the fifth position, while surrounding organic posts are fully randomized. An example feed for the brand-unsafe condition is accessible at https://tiny.cc/DICE1 .↩︎\nThe figure displays five exemplary feeds used in Case Study 2. The positioning of sponsored and organic content in the study was fully randomized. The sponsored posts are highlighted for expositional clarity. Each feed contained identical content: the same thirty-five organic posts and five sponsored posts, as shown in the second column, where both the BOSE and Apple ads are displayed. An example feed is accessible at https://tiny.cc/DICE2.↩︎\nThis approach aligns with recent methodological work on stimulus sampling (Simonsohn, Montealegre, and Evangelidis 2024) which demonstrates that in studies focused on a single manipulated variable (a sponsored post’s position in our case), using diverse stimuli helps ensure effects are not driven by idiosyncratic characteristics of any particular advertisement, increasing both internal and ecological validity.↩︎\nThis expectation is based on each of the 5 sponsored posts being shown once per participant (N=300) in a feed of 40 positions, leading to an average of \\(\\frac{300}{40} = 7.5\\) for each brand’s ad placement across all positions.↩︎",

    "text": "6.1 Basic server setup with Heroku\nHeroku is a commercial cloud hosting provider. It is the simplest way to deploy oTree.\nThe Heroku free plan is sufficient for testing your app, but once you are ready to launch a study, you should upgrade to a paid server, which can handle more traffic. However, Heroku is quite inexpensive, because you only pay for the time you actually use it. If you run a study for only 1 day, you can turn off your dynos and addons, and then you only pay 1/30 of the monthly cost. Often this means you can run a study for just a few dollars.\nTo deploy to Heroku, you should use oTree Hub, which automates your server setup and ensures your server is correctly configured.\noTree Hub also offers error/performance monitoring.\n\n6.1.1 Server performance\nHeroku offers different performance tiers for resources such as your dyno and database. What tier you need depends on how much traffic your app will get, and how it is coded.\nPerformance is a complicated subject since there are many factors that affect performance. oTree Hub’s Pro plan has a “monitor” section that will analyze your logs to identify performance issues.\n\n\n6.1.2 General tips\n\nUpgrade oTree to the latest version\nWith the higher dyno tiers, Heroku provides a “Metrics” tab. Look at “Dyno load”. If users are experiencing slow page load times and your dyno load stays above 1, then you should get a faster dyno. (But don’t run more than 1 web dyno.)\nIf your dyno load stays under 1 but page load times are still slow, the bottleneck might be something else like your Postgres database.",
