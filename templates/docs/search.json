    "text": "DICE combines the control of experimental research with more realistic stimuli that are inspired by social media platforms. The DICE app (which is based on the powerful oTree framework Chen, Schonger, and Wickens 2016) enables you to create realistic social media feeds with customizable content while supporting between-subjects experimental designs. It provides precise dwell time tracking for engagement measurement and integrates seamlessly with popular survey platforms like Qualtrics. For participant recruitment, DICE works smoothly with Prolific, and all collected data is available in convenient formats for analysis.\n\n\nGetting started with the DICE app is straightforward. Visit dice-app.org to access the web interface. You’ll need to create your stimulus configuration in a CSV file, for which we provide a template. After uploading your CSV to a public repository like GitHub, you can use DICE’s web interface to configure and launch your study. The platform handles participant management and data collection automatically.\n\n\n\nOur documentation follows the natural workflow of creating and running a DICE experiment:\nThe Stimuli chapter forms the foundation, showing you how to create and configure your social media feed content using a CSV file. This structured approach ensures precise control over your experimental manipulations while maintaining the authentic feel of social media.\nOnce your stimuli are ready, the Launch a Study chapter guides you through the DICE web interface at dice-app.org. You’ll learn how to configure your experiment, integrate with survey platforms like Qualtrics, and manage participant recruitment through Prolific.\nThe Data chapter then explains how to work with the data DICE collects, including dwell time measurements and user interactions. You’ll learn about data structure, processing, and how to combine DICE data with your survey responses.\nWe’ve included two detailed Case Studies that demonstrate DICE’s capabilities in real research scenarios: one investigating ad recall and position effects, and another examining brand safety in social media advertising. For researchers interested in advanced implementations, the Deployment chapter provides guidance for hosting DICE on your own servers.\n\n\n\nIf you need assistance with DICE, you have several options available:\n\nExplore the documentation chapters\nReview the case studies for practical examples\nVisit our GitHub repository for additional resources\nContact the DICE team for technical support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChen, Daniel L., Martin Schonger, and Chris Wickens. 2016. “oTree—an Open-Source Platform for Laboratory, Online, and Field Experiments.” Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance 9: 88–97. https://doi.org/doi.org/10.1016/j.jbef.2015.12.001."

    "text": "While investigating which content cuts through the clutter (Ordenes et al. 2019), we focus on the content’s position rather than examining a sponsored post’s characteristics (see, e.g., Berger, Moe, and Schweidel 2023 who study the content’s linguistic features). Specifically, we examine whether a sponsored post’s position in a social media feed affects its recall, building on research about recency and primacy effects (see, e.g., Wedel and Pieters 2000; Murphy, Hofacker, and Mizerski 2006; Agarwal, Hosanagar, and Smith 2011). A naïve model reveals a primacy effect, where sponsored posts in higher positions show increased likelihood of recall. However, this effect disappears when controlling for dwell time. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that longer dwell times correlate with higher recall probability for sponsored posts.\nUsing position effects in social media advertising as an illustrative example, the primary goal of this case study is to demonstrate practical applications of the DICE app’s dwell time measurement. By showing how to create a feed and then link post-specific dwell times with self-reported recall measures, we provide a practical template for researchers who intend to combine DICE’s behavioral measures with survey data elicited in tools such as Qualtrics.\n\n\nTo investigate the relationship between ad placement and recall, we simulated social media feeds containing both organic and sponsored posts. Whereas the set of organic and sponsored posts was the same for all participants, the sequence in which the participants were exposed to these posts was unique for every participant as we randomized the sequence between subjects.\nAiming to create ecologically valid stimuli, we populated our experimental feed with thrity-five memes (organic posts) and five consumer electronics advertisements (sponsored posts). Accordingly, we collected memes from 9gag, a popular account with more than sixteen million followers on X (formerly called “Twitter”) that is well known for its internet meme collections. The choice of memes as organic content was deliberate, given their dominant role in social media engagement, particularly among younger users: Malodia et al. (2022) report that 75% of social media users aged 13 to 36 regularly share memes, and 30% of these users share memes daily, with Instagram users sharing over 1 million meme-related posts per day in 2020 (Instagram 2020). This prevalence of meme consumption among younger demographics informed both our recruiting strategy and our selection of sponsored content: we recruited 300 young American participants (\\(M_{age}\\)=29.42 years; 53% female) from Prolific and selected consumer electronics advertisements from established brands (i.e., Apple, Bose, Nintendo, Samsung, Whoop) retrieved from Facebook’s Ad Library–a publicly accessible database that archives advertisements running across Meta’s platforms. The selected sponsored posts showed natural variation in their characteristics, reflecting the diversity of ads users encounter in their daily social media use. This approach aligns with recent methodological work on stimulus sampling (Simonsohn, Montealegre, and Evangelidis 2024) which demonstrates that in studies focused on a single manipulated variable (a sponsored post’s position in our case), using diverse stimuli helps ensure effects are not driven by idiosyncratic characteristics of any particular advertisement, increasing both internal and ecological validity.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1 provides a visual representation of our experimental design, specifically illustrating the randomization of sponsored post positions across participants. The figure plots the position in feed against 15 randomly sampled participants, with different colors representing the five brands. Figure 1.1 demonstrates how the sponsored posts’ positions were randomly distributed throughout the feed, ensuring that each participant encountered the five advertisements in a unique sequence with no systematic patterns in the placement of any particular brand’s advertisements.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Randomized Placement of Sponsored Posts Across Participants’ Feeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants browsed the simulated feed on their own devices (72% Desktop, 25% Mobile, and 3% Tablet), allowing for unobtrusive measurement of dwell time for each post. After scrolling through the feed, we redirected participants to a Qualtrics survey in which they first provided demographic information as a filler task. Subsequently, we measured whether participants recalled seeing the ads by the five brands in the feed. Specifically, we measured cued recall for which we showed participants a list of twenty brands from different categories and asked them to indicate whether they recalled seeing them (see, e.g., Campbell and Keller 2003; Simonov, Valletti, and Veiga 2024). We also included a no-recall option. Finally, participants read a debriefing and were redirected to Prolific.\n\n\n\nWe next illustrate how we configured the feed to match our experimental design. Specifically, we created a CSV file that contains forty rows where each row represents one unique post. To guarantee that the order in which the posts were displayed was randomized between participants, we left the <sequence> column empty. Whenever the DICE app encounters missing values in that column, it assigns random numbers to that cell. Hence, leaving some, or in our case, all cells of this column empty, leads to random numbers and thus, random sequences in which the posts are displayed. Next, we specified the Boolean <sponsored> column and assigned a 0 to all thirty-five organic posts and a 1 to the five sponsored posts. For these sponsored posts, we also specified a <target> which is the URL of landing page participants are directed to if they click on the corresponding sponsored post. As a final step, we uploaded the CSV file to an online repository to create a URL that can be passed to DICE’s web app.\nTable 1.1 shows an excerpt of the exact CSV files we used to create the stimuli for this study. You can download that file here.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: CSV File Used in Study 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndoc_id\ndatetime\ntext\nmedia\nalt_text\nlikes\nreposts\nreplies\nusername\nhandle\nuser_description\nuser_image\nuser_followers\ncommented_post\nsponsored\ntarget\ncondition\nsequence\nsource\n\n\n\n\n34\n20.09.24 12:01\nDental receptionist when you don’t know if you’ll be free at 2:30pm next February\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/GX3wITOX0AAEyhO?format=jpg&name=4096x4096\nNA\n247\n21\n15\n9GAG ❤️ Memeland\n9GAG\nBuilding MEMELAND one meme at a time • 📧 9gag9gag.com • CEO ➡️ 9gagceo.\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1695636573294125056/Jj9IWW10_400x400.jpg\n16812312\n0\n0\nNA\nA\nNA\nhttps://twitter.com/9GAG/status/1836888251941998992\n\n\n35\n19.09.24 06:01\nMe: sends “Good morning” text Also me: sleeps again\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXz48AYXMAA4-Wm?format=jpg&name=medium\nNA\n475\n118\n19\n9GAG ❤️ Memeland\n9GAG\nBuilding MEMELAND one meme at a time • 📧 9gag9gag.com • CEO ➡️ 9gagceo.\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1695636573294125056/Jj9IWW10_400x400.jpg\n16812312\n0\n0\nNA\nA\nNA\nhttps://twitter.com/9GAG/status/1836616460271030578\n\n\n36\n09.10.24 01:00\nTrade in.

In our analyses, we only focus on sponsored posts which is why our final sample comprises 1,283 observations on the participant \\(\\times\\) sponsored post level. This is less than the expected five observations per participant due to two reasons. First, due to connectivity issues: no dwell time data were recorded for around 3.67% of individual–sponsored post pairs. Second, we excluded the first and last two posts of each feed (i.e., \\(300 \\times 4\\) observations) from our analysis, as meaningful dwell times couldn’t be determined for these. This is because participants were familiarizing themselves with the interface at the start and deciding whether to proceed to the next stage of the study at the end of the feeds.\n\n\n\nWe present summary statistics for our final sample, both for participant-level observations and self-reports as well as for user interaction data at the participant \\(\\times\\) sponsored post level (see Table 1.2 and Table 1.3, respectively). [Merge the tables and create sub-headings or panels.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2:  Summary Statistics on the Participant-Level \n \n  \n    Statistic \n    N \n    Mean \n    St. Dev. \n    Min \n    Max \n  \n \n\n  \n    Age \n    300 \n    29.42 \n    4.54 \n    18 \n    49 \n  \n  \n    Female \n    300 \n    0.53 \n    0.50 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Desktop \n    300 \n    0.72 \n    0.45 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Recall Apple \n    300 \n    0.34 \n    0.47 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    ..

Because we randomized the order in which the content appeared (i.e., Position in Feed acts as a within-subject factor) and because we excluded observations positioned at the beginning and the end of the feed, we observe a sample mean of 20.58 as well as a minimum and maximum of 3 and 38, respectively. As, we randomly manipulated the position in which each post was displayed exogenously between subjects, each sequence in which participants browsed through ads was unique.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Distribution of Sponsored Post Impressions by Position in Feed and Brand across All Participants\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1.2, each line represents the number of times a sponsored post for a specific brand appeared at each position across all participants. As the placements were fully randomized, we observed some random variability that naturally fluctuates around the expected value of 7.5 impressions per position (as indicated by dashed lines).1 Taken together, this suggests that randomization within the DICE app was effective.\n\n\n\nThe variable Seconds in Viewport we report in Table 1.3 describes the number of seconds in which at least 50 percent of a post’s pixels were visible on screen (sample mean is 3.92 seconds), which we log-transform to reduce skewness. To calculate our Dwell Time measure we use throughout the analyses in this case study, we then divide it by Post Height, that is, the height in which the corresponding sponsored post was displayed on a participant’s screen as this variable varies within participants and between sponsored posts. The resulting Dwell Time has a sample mean of 0.002 with a Fisher-Pearson skewness of 0.38, which is considered as approximately symmetric (Bulmer 1979).\n\n\n\nWe measured reactions such as likes and replies to individual posts. In the full sample (which includes organic posts), we observe 144 (30) participants who liked (replied to) any post in the feed. Considering sponsored posts only, however, we only count 32 (4) participants who liked (replied to) at least one post, which is why we do not consider these explicit engagement metrics in our analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2 shows that recall varied by brand. Between 48.00% (Nintendo) and 10.33% (Whoop) recalled seeing the sponsored post.

The model can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{p_{ij}}{1-p_{ij}}\\right) = a + \\mathbf{x}_{ij} \\mathbf{b} + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} \\gamma_k Brand_k + u_i + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere \\(p_{ij}\\) is the probability of brand recall for the \\(i\\)-th participant and \\(j\\)-th observation, \\(a\\) is the intercept, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{ij}\\) is a vector of continuous predictors (position in feed and dwell time) with corresponding coefficient vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). The term \\(\\gamma_k\\) represents the fixed effects for each brand \\(k\\) (with one Apple serving as the reference category), and \\(u_i\\) captures the fixed effects for each participant. Finally, \\(\\epsilon{ij}\\) represents the idiosyncratic error term for participant \\(i\\) and observation \\(j\\).\nThe random participant effects \\(u_i\\) are justified by the experimental design, as the random assignment of ad positions ensures zero correlation between participant characteristics and the explanatory variables. Brand effects are treated as fixed parameters rather than random effects, allowing for potential correlation between brand characteristics and key explanatory variables such as dwell time."

    "text": "1.2 Case Study 2: When Does Context Harm Brands? Manipulating Feed Composition to Study Brand Safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary goal of our second case study is to demonstrate another feature of the DICE app: the experimental manipulation of (advertising) context. Whereas Case Study 1 used a single set of social media posts and randomized its display sequence, this study creates different sets of content for different groups of participants while keeping one sponsored post constant across all groups. Accordingly, we systematically manipulate the context in which participants encounter the sponsored post by varying the surrounding content they see.\nWe demonstrate this capability by examining brand safety in social media advertising. Brand safety refers to strategies and measures dedicated to ensuring that advertising does not appear in contexts that could harm brand reputation (Fournier and Srinivasan 2023; Porter 2021). This concern is particularly relevant for social media advertising, where platforms use automated systems to place ads in dynamic, user-generated content environments because, these systems often lack the nuanced understanding needed to identify potentially problematic contexts. Industry reports suggest that 75% of brands have experienced brand-unsafe exposures (GumGum Inc. 2017), with ads frequently appearing alongside problematic content despite blacklists and negative targeting strategies (Simonov, Valletti, and Veiga 2024; Ahmad et al. 2024). Not solely by controlling but by manipulating the sponsored post’s context (i.e., organic posts), the DICE app allows us to investigate sensitive challenges in an experimental setting without risking actual brand reputation damage (which would make field settings infeasible).\n\n1.2.1 Experimental Design\nTo examine how brand-(un)safe contexts affect brand perceptions, we created two social media feeds that were identical in structure but varied in their content surrounding a sponsored post. Both feeds contained the same number of organic posts and one identical sponsored post, with the only difference being the thematic focus of the organic content.\nTo ensure ecological validity, we populated our experimental feeds with actual tweets covering Brazil: one feed featured coverage of severe flooding that claimed at least 95 lives (Buschschlüter 2024), while the other contained typical Brazil-related content including Madonna’s free concert in Rio de Janeiro, soccer matches, and travel experiences. This approach mirrors real-world scenarios where automated ad placement systems, operating primarily on keywords (e.g., “Brazil”), might place the same ad in vastly different contextual environments.\nThe sponsored post, a fictitious KLM advertisement promoting flights to Brazil, was identical across both conditions. The creative featured the tagline: “Brazil’s wild beauty calls! Experience nature like never before. Book your breathtaking adventure with KLM.” This messaging, while typically appropriate for airline promotion, becomes strikingly insensitive when juxtaposed against a feed focusing on the natural disaster in the region advertised, which is precisely the type of contextual mismatch that automated systems might create.\nTo control for position effects identified in Case Study 1, we placed KLM’s sponsored post in fifth position in both conditions. While this position remained constant, we randomized the sequence of organic posts between subjects to ensure any effects weren’t driven by specific content adjacencies.\n\n\n1.2.2 Procedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in the first case study, participants browsed the simulated feed on their own devices (75% Desktop, 21% Mobile, and 4% Tablet). After scrolling through the feed, we redirected participants to a Qualtrics survey in which they first provided demographic information as a filler task. Subsequently, we measured whether participants recalled seeing the ads by the five brands in the feed. Specifically, we measured cued recall for which we showed participants a list of ten brands and asked them to indicate indicate which ones they remembered seeing. We also included a no-recall option to reduce false positives. To assess brand perceptions, participants then evaluated their attitudes toward KLM using three seven-point scales (1 = “Negative/Unfavorable/Dislike” and 7 = “Positive/Favorable/Like”; \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.96). Subsequently, participants indicated their awareness of the Brazil flooding situation before reading a debriefing and being redirected to Prolific.\n\n\n1.2.3 Stimuli\nBuilding on the CSV file structure introduced in Case Study 1, we created a file containing two distinct sets of content: nineteen organic posts for each experimental condition, plus one sponsored post that needed to appear in both feeds. To ensure the sponsored post would appear in both conditions while maintaining DICE’s CSV structure, we entered the sponsored post twice in the file - once for each condition. This resulted in a file with forty rows total: nineteen organic posts for each condition plus the sponsored post appearing twice. Each post’s content was specified in columns such as <text> and <username>. We used the <condition> parameter to distinguish between our “appropriate” (brand-safe) and “inappropriate” (brand-unsafe) feeds, assigning each row (i.e., each post) to its respective condition. Similar to Case Study 1, we left the <sequence> column empty for organic posts to enable randomization, with one key exception: the KLM sponsored post was assigned a fixed <sequence> value of “5” to ensure consistent positioning across conditions. We marked this post as sponsored using the <sponsored> parameter and included a KLM landing page URL in the <target> column for participants who clicked on the ad. The resulting CSV file was uploaded to an online repository to generate a URL for the DICE app.\nTable 1.5 shows an excerpt of the exact CSV files we used to create the stimuli for this study.

Participants were randomly assigned to view either the brand-safe feed (featuring general Brazil-related content) or the brand-unsafe feed (featuring flood coverage). A key advantage of DICE over observational and platform studies is its ability to implement true random assignment, allowing us to isolate the effect of context while canceling out other factors that might influence brand perception. To validate DICE’s randomization functionality, we examined the balance between treatment groups: as illustrated in Table 1.6, the two treatment groups do not exhibit differences in observables. Following Kerwin, Rostom, and Sterck (2024), we also found support for balanced conditions in an omnibus test of joint orthogonality with randomization inference (\\(p=\\) 0.42).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.6: Covariate Balance Across Conditions\n\n\nCovariate\nAppropriate\nInappropriate\nDifference\np-value\n\n\n\n\nMean Age (Years)\n38.689\n38.609\n-0.081\n0.924\n\n\nFemale (Percent)\n57.669\n53.550\n-4.119\n0.194\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Data\nOur dataset comprises 982 participants and 15,343 observations at the participant \\(\\times\\) post level. Whereas Case Study 1 analyzed multiple sponsored posts across participants, here we focus on a single sponsored post (i.e., the KLM ad) viewed by all participants, which simplifies our analytical approach. Our final sample comprises 955 observations on the participant level, which is slightly less than the expected one observation per participant due to connectivity issues: no dwell time data were recorded for around 2.75% of the sponsored posts.\nThis simplified “short” data structure has two convenient methodological implications. First, because we analyze one observation per participant rather than nested data, we can apply simpler methods such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions in our analyses. Second, because we only focus on one sponsored post, we do not need to divide our dwell time measure by the post’s height as we did in Case Study 1. Both aspects increase the interpretability of our results.\nTable 1.7 shows an excerpt of the processed data to illustrate its nested (i.e., “long”) structure.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.7: Processed Data Analyzed in Study 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant ID\nPosition in Feed\nLikes\nReplies\nSeconds in Viewport\nDwell Time\nBrand Attitudes\nAge\nFemale\nDesktop\nRecall\n\n\n\n\n59e833e72f63d30001c8fb86\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n1.783\n0.5782973\n4.000000\n36\nFALSE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n59f226a9d6380600018b2923\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n6.393\n1.8552036\n5.333333\n60\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\n\n\n5a0ef93279f96a0001c73f25\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n3.500\n1.2527630\n4.000000\n31\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a42c80ddaea400001ac24e0\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n10.239\n2.3262040\n5.000000\n47\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a542b96e0cf3d0001260df1\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n1.111\n0.1052605\n4.000000\n38\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a5c2c2eeedc320001429df1\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n20.422\n3.0166128\n4.000000\n33\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a7618b18fe2dc0001057243\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n3.866\n1.3522204\n6.000000\n43\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a78e410ae9a0b0001a97274\n5\nTRUE\nFALSE\n5.915\n1.7774915\n6.000000\n32\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a91756d6475f900019f90f1\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n4.484\n1.5005155\n4.000000\n43\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n5a9fc2b66475f90001a0219a\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n3.165\n1.1521531\n1.333333\n31\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n5aaf4b0ce1546900019b01de\n5\nFALSE\nFALSE\n0.301\n-1.2006450\n4.000000\n43\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgarwal, Ashish, Kartik Hosanagar, and Michael D.

    "text": "The DICE app was designed to fit into a consumer researcher’s typical workflow where participants are recruited (e.g., via Prolific) before they are exposed to stimuli and survey items (e.g., in Qualtrics). The key procedural difference in using the DICE app (compared to software such as Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Powerpoint) is that the stimuli are not configured graphically but tabularly: the DICE app requires researchers to configure a csv file that provides information on each post, such as the actual content, engagement metrics, and the corresponding username. The app then loops through that file (while filtering for conditions) to display each row as a separate post embedded in an interactive feed. The advantage of this procedural difference is that while it requires the same amount of information as the graphical configuration, it is less time consuming and less error prone because the software handles the graphical representation consistently. In addition, the tabular configuration is more accessible as researchers are trained to work with csv, as opposed to Photoshop files."

    "text": "2.2 Design Columns\nBefore Video 2.1 describes the columns in more detail, we focus on the design columns and describe how researchers can configure them to implement their experimental designs.\n\n2.2.1 Conditions\nResearchers can leverage the condition configuration column to set up between-subjects designs by assigning the respective rows with N different values (e.g., “treatment 1”, “treatment 2”, …, “treatment N”). The DICE app will then count the number on unique values and create N different treatment groups. When launching a study, participants will then be assigned to these groups randomly and uniformly such that the group sizes do not differ in expectation. In case study 2, we show how we leveraged this variable to create two conditions that contain two different sets of nineteen organic posts but share the same sponsored post. As each row can only be assigned to one condition, this required us to enter the sponsored post twice within the configuration file: both versions contained the same post and user configurations and only differed with respect to their condition. Similarly, if researchers want to display the same set of organic posts in N conditions, then they have to enter N copies of that set of posts and adjust the condition column accordingly.\n\n\n2.2.2 Sequences\nAnother important configuration column is sequence. It defines the order in which posts are displayed and gives researchers control over the order in which posts are displayed. Explicit sequences can be useful to study ordering and ranking of social media posts. Researchers can, for instance, use the user interactions measured in a previous study to rank the by engagement to approximate a platform’s recommender systems. Importantly, this column is special as the DICE app replaces missing values with random numbers for each participant individually. This is a feature we leveraged in both of our case studies: in Case Study 2, we only defined the sequence of the sponsored post such that it was always displayed in fifth position. The sequence configuration column was not assigned to any of the organic posts. Hence, each participant experienced a different sequence of organic posts. In Case Study 1, we left that sequence column empty for every post to randomize the order of both sponsored and organic posts. This resulted in a diverse set of sequences that we exploited to study primacy effects in ad recall.\n\n\n2.2.3 Threads\nFinally, the commented_post configuration column is interesting for researches who want to investigate discussions as it changes the social media feed’s appearance slightly. If one post is assigned to a 1 in this column, this post will serve as a “parent post” whereas all other posts will be displayed a comments of that parent post."

In both cases, you need to specify the number of rows in a database that will be created specifically for your study. Each row can be assumed by one participant. If there is attrition, that is, if a participant enters the study but leaves before finishing it, the row in the database will be taken and cannot be overwritten by other participants. Hence, you should consider attrition while specifying the number of rows in the database as participants who try to enter the experiment after all slots (rows in the database) are used, will receive an error message.\nWhereas it is therefore costly for you to underestimate attrition, it is also costly for you (and us) to overestimate attrition and enter an unreasonably large number of desired rows because this can have implications on the performance. Hence, we enforce a maximum of 600 rows here. Feel free to contact us, if you require larger sample sizes and we’ll schedule a session together."

    "text": "3.4 Stimulus Design\n\n3.4.1 Social Media Platform\n\n\n3.4.2 URL\nIn this section, you will provide the csv file you created to configure your stimuli as described in Chapter 2. The DICE app “ingests” these configurations if you provide raw URL to the file. This requires you to upload the csv file in a publicly available storage (we recommend GitHub as it is free and easy-to-use).\nThe DICE app needs access to your CSV file through what’s called a “raw” URL. A raw URL points directly to the file’s content, allowing DICE to read your configuration. Think of it as a direct link to the raw data, rather than a webpage showing the file.\n\n3.4.2.1 What is a Raw URL?\nWhen you share files through platforms like GitHub, the standard URL typically leads to a webpage that displays your file. However, DICE needs a special type of URL - a raw URL - that leads directly to the file’s content. A raw URL usually follows this pattern:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/main/filename.csv\nThe key difference is that a raw URL starts with raw. in the domain name. This tells the server to send the pure file content rather than a webpage displaying the file.\n\n\n3.4.2.2 Getting a Raw URL\nIf you’re using GitHub, you can find the raw URL by navigating to your file and clicking the “Raw” button. The URL in your browser will then show the correct format that DICE needs. If you prefer using Google Drive, you can share your CSV file and get a direct link. First, share the file by setting it to “Anyone with the link can view.” Then, instead of using the standard sharing link, modify it by replacing “file/d/” with “uc?export=download&id=” and removing everything after the file ID. Your Google Drive URL should look like this:\nhttps://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID\n\n\n3.4.2.3 Using Your Raw URL\nOnce you have the raw URL, simply paste it into DICE where requested. The app will automatically fetch your configuration file and use it to set up your study.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 CSV Delimiter\nYour CSV file uses a special character to separate different pieces of data (like columns). While commas are the most common delimiter, some files use other characters. Select the character that matches your CSV file format - for example, if your data is separated by semicolons, choose “Semicolon” from the dropdown menu.\n\n\n3.4.4 Hashtag\nEnter the term you want participants to see in the search bar of your simulated social media interface. Using a hashtag or a username creates a more authentic social media experience, as it mimics how users typically search for content on platforms like Twitter. This search term will appear pre-filled in the interface’s search bar when participants start the study."

To generate you final dataset which includes behavioral measures, the stimuli, as well as self-reports, we advise you to merge the processed data with two other data sources. First, merge the shiny app’s output with your survey data using the participant_label as a key. Because the DICE app passes that ID to your survey tool, both datasets have these information. Second, merge that data with you stimuli csv (see Chapter 2) based on the doc_id and condition, if applicable.\nUsing R and the {data.table} package, this process looks as follows:\n\noutput <- data.table::merge.data.table(x = dice,\n                                       y = qualtrics,\n                                       by = \"participant_label\")\n\nfinal <- data.table::merge.data.table(x = output,\n                          y = stimuli,\n                          by = c(\"doc_id\", \"condition\"))\n\nsetorder(final, participant_code, displayed_sequence)"

    "section": "6.1 Basic server setup with Heroku",
    "text": "6.1 Basic server setup with Heroku\nHeroku is a commercial cloud hosting provider. It is the simplest way to deploy oTree.\nThe Heroku free plan is sufficient for testing your app, but once you are ready to launch a study, you should upgrade to a paid server, which can handle more traffic. However, Heroku is quite inexpensive, because you only pay for the time you actually use it. If you run a study for only 1 day, you can turn off your dynos and addons, and then you only pay 1/30 of the monthly cost. Often this means you can run a study for just a few dollars.\nTo deploy to Heroku, you should use oTree Hub, which automates your server setup and ensures your server is correctly configured.\noTree Hub also offers error/performance monitoring.\n\n6.1.1 Server performance\nHeroku offers different performance tiers for resources such as your dyno and database. What tier you need depends on how much traffic your app will get, and how it is coded.\nPerformance is a complicated subject since there are many factors that affect performance. oTree Hub’s Pro plan has a “monitor” section that will analyze your logs to identify performance issues.\n\n\n6.1.2 General tips\n\nUpgrade oTree to the latest version\nWith the higher dyno tiers, Heroku provides a “Metrics” tab. Look at “Dyno load”. If users are experiencing slow page load times and your dyno load stays above 1, then you should get a faster dyno. (But don’t run more than 1 web dyno.)\nIf your dyno load stays under 1 but page load times are still slow, the bottleneck might be something else like your Postgres database."
