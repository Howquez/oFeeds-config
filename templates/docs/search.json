Even if you’re not familiar with using the terminal or command prompt, you’ll find that the process is straightforward and easy to follow. The commands you’ll be using are simple, and you’ll be guided through each step. Remember, many researchers who aren’t computer experts use oTree successfully every day. So take a deep breath, follow along, and you’ll have your experiment up and running in no time!\nWhat’s more, oTree has a large and active user community, which brings several advantages:\nWhether you prefer reading documentation, asking the community, or using AI tools, help is always at hand. Hence, we are confident that you’ll have your experiment up and running in no time!"

You’ll use it to run commands for installing and running oTree.\n\nOn Windows: Search for “Command Prompt” or “PowerShell” in the Start menu.\nOn macOS: Open the “Terminal” application (found in Applications > Utilities).\nOn Linux: You can usually open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T or by searching for “Terminal” in your application menu."

Then use the command prompt or terminal and run the otree unzip command to extract the contents of the otreezip file:\notree unzip DICE.otreezip\nIf necessary, adjust the path to the otreezip file.\nThis will unpack the experiment such that you can browse and edit its raw files. One of them is called requirements.txt. You can find it in my_DICE_experiment/ (or whatever name you chose for your project directory). You should have all the requirements installed but it may not hurt to re-install them using:\npip install -r requirements.txt"

    "text": "3.1 Basic server setup with Heroku\nHeroku is a commercial cloud hosting provider. It is the simplest way to deploy oTree.\nThe Heroku free plan is sufficient for testing your app, but once you are ready to launch a study, you should upgrade to a paid server, which can handle more traffic. However, Heroku is quite inexpensive, because you only pay for the time you actually use it. If you run a study for only 1 day, you can turn off your dynos and addons, and then you only pay 1/30 of the monthly cost. Often this means you can run a study for just a few dollars.\nTo deploy to Heroku, you should use oTree Hub, which automates your server setup and ensures your server is correctly configured.\noTree Hub also offers error/performance monitoring.\n\n3.1.1 Server performance\nHeroku offers different performance tiers for resources such as your dyno and database. What tier you need depends on how much traffic your app will get, and how it is coded.\nPerformance is a complicated subject since there are many factors that affect performance. oTree Hub’s Pro plan has a “monitor” section that will analyze your logs to identify performance issues.\n\n\n3.1.2 General tips\n\nUpgrade oTree to the latest version\nWith the higher dyno tiers, Heroku provides a “Metrics” tab. Look at “Dyno load”. If users are experiencing slow page load times and your your dyno load stays above 1, then you should get a faster dyno. (But don’t run more than 1 web dyno.)\nIf your dyno load stays under 1 but page load times are still slow, the bottleneck might be something else like your Postgres database."
